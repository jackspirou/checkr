# checkr
A package providing interaction with the Checkr API

This package currently implements on the basic functionality needed by Outdoorsy. This include: Candidates, Reports, MVR Screenings and Webhooks. I will try to build this out more in the future, but time constraints are not allowing me to create a fully fledged SDK at this time.

Please feel free to submit issues and PRs. If you wish to submit a PR, please follow the conventions already present in the package.
